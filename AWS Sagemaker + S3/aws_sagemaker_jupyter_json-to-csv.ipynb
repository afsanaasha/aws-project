Anyone, from advanced users - to beginners looking for knowledge - can profit from every issue of MaxPC. the icing on the cake is the subscription that comes with a CD-ROM as it is packed with demos, utilities, and other useful apps (very helpful for those not blessed with broadband connections). Until I discovered the community of hardware enthusiast web sites, MaxPC, formerly \"boot\", was my only really informative source for computing news and articles. To this day, i consider my subscription to it worth more than 10 subscriptions to most other computing mags. I can\\'t wait until they merge with DVD media and maybe end up offering more info on Divx codecs, encoding your own movies, and best bang for the buck audio and video equipment. Try a few issues (with CD)and you may get hooked...',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'Antiques Magazine is a publication made for antique lovers and history buffs and its pages are loaded with photos of artistic paintings, handmade goods, rare pictures, and other items of similar nature. It is a magazine for those who love antiques and also those who consider themselves historians since many articles deal with historical collections of art and antiques.\\n\\nThis magazine is overflowing with antique goods and information. The articles contained in this magazine are intended to be visually stimulating in some cases, educational in others. They offer history lessons on the art that was popular during a specific era, a glimpse into an art collection at a museum, and more. The articles are meant to stimulate the interests of those who already like this subject and they often provide a means to learn more, to discover places to see or purchase some of the featured works, and to develop an appreciation for the craftsmanship that went into making these items.\\n\\nAntiques Magazine is a publication dedicated to creative art and history but one thing that isn\\'t very creative is the titles of the articles. This might surprise some readers at first, but the editors at Antiques decided to get straight to the point in the naming of the featured articles rather than try to be creative. The features thus have titles like \"The Eating Utensil Collection\", \"Spanish Culture in Art\", etc. Each title points out exactly what the article covers, leaving nothing to the imagination.\\n\\nThe writing in Antiques is certainly good and well- edited. But I\\'m afraid that many readers will find the articles a little boring. They describe things well and they usually offer a good history lesson. But they lack spark and readability. I have tried to read some articles in this magazine and found my eyelids getting heavy and my thoughts drifting to other subjects. This is why I generally stick with the pictures when I glance at Antiques Magazine. I don\\'t bother reading because most of the material doesn\\'t keep my interest.\\n\\nOverall, Antiques Magazine is an okay publication and unless you have a deep interest in antiques and their history, you will likely become bored quickly if you try to read the articles. But the pictures in Antiques are often very interesting. Even if you have little interest in reading a magazine like this one, the photos alone make it worth an occasional look.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"I've read Maximum PC (MPC) for many years. The articles in it are not too technical and are written with light humor. That makes it very easy to read while at the same time it is imparting in-depth technical know-how.\\n\\n If you are a newbie, in no time you possess expert knowledge of computers and, to an extent, of electronics.\\n\\nIf you are already advanced, then you get even more advanced. Period.\\n\\nAs an MPC reader you naturally become the PC nerd amongst your friends, family, and coworkers, that everybody keeps coming to for advise and requests for help.\\n\\nFor instance at the launch of new operating system, such as with windows 8, and win 7, you'll get mobbed by confused hordes of PC users with a lost sense of direction.\\n\\nYou become their sole bastion of hope standing solidly there in the middle, that they can hold on to for guidance.\\n\\nThere are also little tid bits of information that can unexpectedly result in huge payoffs. In a little corner in one issue for example, they showed how to insert a check mark in my Utorrent software, that encrypted its outgoing traffic, so that my ISP couldn't invade my privacy anymore, and so had to stop bothering and threatening me about my sharing of copyrighted materials with my friends. That was a relief!\\n\\nI also like the fact that the magazine deals with both computer hardware, and software - though the emphasis is on hardware.\\n\\nThere are also letters to the computer doctor who diagnoses and then gives good advice on a range of computer illnesses and hiccups.\\n\\nYou also get the latest news taking place in the tech world and on copyright issues.\\n\\nOverall It is a well rounded publication with a little for everyone, young and old, great and small.\\n\\nI have the kindle for Ipad version, and it is the absolute best. Better than the Maximum PC app itself that doesn't really work.\",\n",

My only defense is where else can you get an hour (or so) entertainment for 42 cents a month? Even double that price is still an insanely low price for such quality content.\\n\\nI\\'m glad I\\'m back on board after all these years.

THe problem is if you sign up for auto-renew, Amazon will make it very difficult to stop it.  The most obvious solution, click the \"stop auto-renew\" button does absolutely nothing except take you to the top of the page. WOW. Thank God I was able to return to the top of the page.  But Wait, that\\'s not your only option: you can also click the \"cancel subscription\" button.  It, too, takes you to the top of the page. Ah-ha, we have a pattern here.  At the top of the page is a sentence stating that you must call a certain phone number to cancel or change subscriptions. So those two buttons are... the modern day racing stripes for a web site with no function at all, mererly appearance? But this slick, digital interface Will help you utilize their 130 year old technology to stop your subscription. I knew the 19th and 20th centuries would be exciting, and that webpage is certainly the cat\\'s pajamas.\\n  I guess I\\'ll just stop all auto-renewals rather than get all pissed off and going on a rant each time.\\nAgain, the magazine is good for a lot of people.  If you\\'ve been in the business for less than ten years, you\\'ll probably enjoy it.',\n",

There's the more risque like Maxim or even the low-brow Stuff, worth getting. Then there are those that fall somewhere in the middle, like FHM and Details. Even without seeing magazines like Esquire or Maxim, you can see that Details falls short. It's a glossy magazine that usually has pretty good covers, but that's where the excellence stops. The articles are generally substandard. They are usually poorly written or can't seem to get the facts straight. Their only saving grace is that they are so short (which is a problem when you run across the occasionally well-done, interesting article). And Details is not a magazine that seems to have its hand on the\\npulse of the nation. More often than not, you skim through, looking for something interesting to read, and close it finding none. And in a men's interest/fashion magazine, nothing is more important than the photos. Unfortunately they are not that great. The photo spreads are way too short. But since the photographers have taken amatuerish or just poorly done\\nphotographs, it actually works out. Basically what you have with\\nDetails is a magazine that wants to be one of the big boys, but hasn't found a way to get there. You'd do better spending your money on an Esquire subscription.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"I've been a reader for over 4 years, and their magazine is simply the best PC magazine available.  The only downside is that they use a service like coverleaf for their digital version, which is so behind the times they offer no Android app, and they offer no digital-only subscriptions.  I'm no 'tree-hugger' but I prefer to cut down on paper and clutter, and cut down on the stuff I end up throwing in the trash.  I have an Android tablet on which I read a lot of things now, and I'd love to be able to subscribe to Maximum PC in a digital-only version, but it appears that is not something that is available.  For a magazine that is cutting-edge, you'd think they'd have it available.  The lack of a digital-only subscription is the only reason I give it 4 out of 5 stars.  Content of the magazine and the website are both great, so they get HUGE points for that.  If they had a digital only subscription I'd certainly give it 5-stars.\",\n",

Most of the information in this magazine can be found for free on the internet. You can even find the same content on Maximum PC's website. So what are you really getting for your subscription fee? Chances are if you are thinking about getting this magazine you already have a smartphone, tablet pc, or other device that will let you read the website for free.\\n\\nThe other thing to think about is that the information you are reading in this months magazine is more than a month old. For example, in this month's issue they were raving about the Intel's Sandy Bridge chipset. Last month this was important information. However, today it is more important that Intel just announced flaws in the Sandy Bridge chipset and has issued a recall.\\n\\nFinally, many of the gear review articles have a flavor to them that seem like they are just paid puff pieces from the manufacturer. I just can't believe that almost everything they review is the next best thing.\\n\\nMaybe I'm just a cynic because I used to work in the journalism industry, but when my subscription runs out I'm done. I'll just stick to the web for my gear reviews and news.\",\n",

Maximum PC does a great job at covering things that are actually interesting and relevant to the average power user.

Further investigation utilizing Fakespot  Review Analysis showed that the product received an F for the large number of false positive reports.

       "  'reviewText': 'Hi! This is a good magazine. I will cut to the chase about why I subscribe to it and the reason why most everyone else out there does too - it\\'s those program CD-ROMs that include a ton of things that you can use that are mostly all free. Yah, I can go out and find them myself instead of having the CD-ROM at your disposal, but often you do not know what you are looking for when you search online for a solution or program... ... or your search engine overlooks a program(s) out there that you want. There are tons of handy and very useful tools and utilities on them.  It saves me a lot of work searching. This is the plus.\\nNow, the magazine articles are okay. Lately, I have found that they are discussing issues not of importance to me. I am seeing more ads in them than the older issues that had better old core help providing assistance with common programs users have and solutions to common issues. Once in a while I find in an issue an article I like that serves some use, but it is now hit or miss. It used to be that EVERY issue had some practical assistance I could use. Again, the reason that I subscribe is those CD-ROMs, I will not lie here.\\nNow, the latest issue I am having with them is there subscription renewal service after you have had them for one year (or more) and they tell you that you need to renew when you haven\\'t finished receiving all your paid subscription issues. They tell you that you HAVE received (in my case) all 12 issues when I have only received 10 to date. They state that they expect to receive you payment for renewal when you haven\\'t finished your first year subscription service. NOW, WAIT A MINUTE HERE! I still have 2 issues before my current subscription is done.  I believe that I will pay them when my renewal is done. After I receive my last two (2) issues for this subscription period, them I will pay to renew for the next subscription period. The reason why I do not pay in advance is I will get short changed and it makes it very difficult to correct this issue at a later date.  I had an issue with this and I need it resolved, so I contacted their customer service department via e-mail.  They replied back to me promptly. They stated that my last two issues were in the mailing process and my current subscription period will expire in November 2010 which is correct. I agree when it will expire. We are on the same page here. However, \"when payment is received, service will continue through the October 2010 issue.\" Now, this is B.S. They are holding back on my last 2 issues that I paid for until they receive my payment. What if I did NOT want to renew this magazine? Does this mean I do not get my last 2 issues (Oct. & Nov. 2010) that I paid for? This is not fair business practices!!! They are still obligated to still send me my last 2 issues regardless if I renew or not. I am a little angered here. Yes, I like the magazine for obvious reasons and I will renew; but this is not fair at all! This is some deceptive marking trick to keep you subscribed and keep you paying to receive all your issues you already paid for!',\n",

Some of the the ones off the top of my head that seemed to read well eventually completely skipped like actually burn a dvd via a chosen suite.

I ordered this and found out that this is the PRINT ONLY edition. NO CD's. Upon calling Maximum PC they said it would be another [...] per month for the CDs but the biggest kick in the rear end, is that I could only get 10 of the CDs now, because I had the first issue and the second issue was too close to shipping. IF I JUST WANTED THE MAGAZINE I COULD HAVE JUST DOWNLOADED THE FREE PDF'S THAT MAXIMUM PC MAKES AVAILABLE ON THERE WEBSITE. I WANTED BOTH.

However, I am disappointed with the magazine itself, now that I have been receiving it for about six months. As some of the other reviewers have noted, a huge portion of the magazine is taken up with glossy advertising, most of which is for clothing that only investment bankers or movie stars are likely to purchase. I like clothes, but it would be nice to see clothing lines other than couture advertised. More disturbingly, the magazine seems to have a split personality in its approach to masculinity. Many articles are written from the viewpoint of the stereotypical uber-masculine American male, with lots of references to heterosexual relationships, and other \"guy stuff.\" Yet other articles come off as attempting to be from a gay-friendly viewpoint. I prefer the latter, but I don\\'t see the point in having gay-friendly material when the rest of the magazine is trying to be a go-to guide for red-blooded males. I guess I don\\'t fully \"get\" the editorial viewpoint that Details (purports to be) espousing. Consequently, I won\\'t be ordering another subscription.',\n",

Half of the mag is made up of advertisements with another 1/4 of the mag dedicated to more advertisement with side notes put in.  Only 1/4 of the mag is made up of actual articles and even those are \"bleh\".  For example, my buddy just picked up the mag and said, \"is there something you wanna tell me?\".  Why did he say that?  Because there were 4 articles on being gay or the wonderful rich feeling that comes with being gay.  Uhhhhh, ok.  I just wanted to know how to dress nice.  For example, Tom Ford writes that if your straight you must sleep with a member of the opposite sex at least once in your life and then proceeds to call you a dunderhead if you don\\'t. Ok, fine, I get that, it\\'s an opinion by a fashion designer. But then a couple pages later there\\'s a huge article written by the mag itself about \"the rise of the alpha-gay\".

Inside there was an article glorifying Planned Parenthood as our nation\\'s most holy organization, which appeared right next to one that lamented plus size models having hourglass figures (presumably this is insulting to women with unhealthy levels of visceral fat). There was also an article about flowers and their importance to protests and the \"Resist\" movement. The only other content was ads and product shilling. Why they felt the need to politicize fashion/beauty is beyond me, and I cant imagine anyone wants to get their social/political commentary sandwiched between lipstick and shampoo ads out of a magazine called \"Allure\". Out of curiousity I checked the publication page and surprise, surprise, Linda Wells is no longer cheif editor. This magazine is now under the tutelage of someone from Nylon named Michelle Lee, and she\\'s done a wonderful job of making something as uncontroversial as women\\'s fashion/beauty into something divisive and alienating to anyone who doesn\\'t share her world view.',\n",

Bass Player has changed over the years and I enjoy the newer articles on the rockers that I actually listen to in real life. I don't care so much for the jazz and upright bass scene, but the articles are interesting to read just the same. I find almost all the bass transcriptions way beyond my ability, but that probably only shows my lack of skill. I don't know how some reviewers state that the magazine is good for beginners, everything seems just beyond my reach, and I have been successfully playing bass in a cover band for years. I do think Bass Player is making more of an attempt at reaching players at my level, but they just don't seem to hit the mark, IMHO. I read the articles and get motivated by the stories. So the magazine is good in that respect.\\n\\nIf I want to learn how to play something I can use in the band, I turn to YouTube.com for a video lesson or ultimate-guitar.com for the bass tab. Both of those resources are free, and have the resource material I need to learn to play a song. Bass Player typically only has one bass transcription per issue. If I could actually play some of those transcriptions, maybe I would feel more positive about it. But Bass Player typically picks songs with complicated bass lines that are beyond my ability. If you can play complicated extended 16th note bass lines, there is probably some good material there.\\n\\nBass Player is an OK magazine, but I wish there was an alternative.

       "  'reviewText': 'Details is a mildly interesting magazine that is geared toward men of various ages and lifestyles. The main group that Details aims to capture is the 17 to 35 year- old male but there are articles in each magazine that could be appealing to men of many different ages, mostly in the middle to upper income groups.\\n\\nSome things about Details quickly set it apart from other magazines. One difference is the \"departments\". Most magazines have departments, but instead of talking about the same things each month, these departments vary in their content (the only exceptions being \"Know- Tell\" and the \"The Details\"). Each one contains similar stories from one month to the next, but with different subtitles, helping to make each issue a little fresher than it would otherwise be.\\n\\nAs far as the writing goes, Details offers a great deal of diversity for a magazine. Yes, it is generally focused on things of interest to men, but it covers a very broad range of interests. You can find articles in this magazine on such diverse topics as the death penalty, raising kids, buying a new coat, setting up an internet business, breaking up with a girlfriend, or purchasing the best vodka. There are articles geared toward single men and married men, as well as younger men and middle- aged men.\\n\\nI like some of the articles found here but there is one problem I have with the writing in Details. It is common to find eye- catching headlines on the cover of Details that tempt you to find out more. This is nothing new and most every magazine does this. But the problem is that many of these eye- popping stories fail to keep you amazed when you read them. Take for example an article in a recent issue. On the front, it reads \"Is Your Wife a Bad Mom\"? It sound like an engaging, intellectual read. But once you find the article and take in its 1,000+ words, you quickly discover that there is little or no substance. Basically, it simply tells men that accusing your wife of being a bad mom is a risky undertaking that could hurt her feelings. That is it. There is no intellectual analysis or quotes from studies; only the bottom line conclusion that mothers generally don\\'t like to be called incompetent by their husbands. Other headlining articles in this magazine lead to similar disappointment.\\n\\nThe writing in this magazine is on the edge and very blunt. It is common to find several four- letter words in many of the articles and while this doesn\\'t bother me at all, I know that some readers will consider it too raw, too edgy, and too explicit. Details writers have no problem telling it like it is, and this can be both good and bad depending on one\\'s perspective.\\n\\nBesides the language, some parts of this magazine could offend certain readers; namely the \"Anthropology\" page at the end. This closing \"article\" is meant to be humorous, but some readers will not see it that way. I don\\'t know if it has always been this way, but what \"Anthropology\" does is show a person or multiple people and then asks the question \"Gay or ______\". For example, I have seen titles like \"Gay or Best Friends?\", \"Gay or Cowboy?\", \"Gay or Neo Punk Rocker?\", and others. With each of these, there is a diagram of sorts with arrows pointing to different clothing and bodily features and short comments about each one. Basically, it is asking you to think about these different attributes of the person or people in the picture and then decide if the way they dress, look, and act makes them gay. I find this silly and immature, but I can see how some readers would find it insulting. I don\\'t know if Details has always done this or if the Anthropology page has been different in the past. But this is how it has been in every issue I have read and it needs to be changed.\\n\\nAdvertisements claim about sixty percent of the pages in each issue of this magazine. They cover products like liquor, cars, electronics, cigarettes, fragrance, etc. Even though this magazine covers lots of different things, the item most often featured in the advertisements is clothing. The magazine seems to have a penchant for high fashion and it devotes more pages to expensive clothing than anything else. And each issue often has its own unique smell, thanks to all of the cologne samples. You can flip through the pages and find several samples in each issue, with many of the latest and trendiest scents from the biggest names in cologne.\\n\\nOverall, I am torn between liking or not liking Details Magazine. I like some of the articles on food, drink, politics and the like. But I don\\'t necessarily like the shallow fluff that is often substituted for an intellectual discussion and I can understand how some readers would find certain aspects of this magazine insulting. This magazine is deserving of only about two and one- half stars which I will round up to three stars and give a small recommendation. Some will like this magazine and some will not. It\\'s all a matter of what you like to read about and whether or not you can handle a magazine that pushes the envelope.',\n",

I actually finished the entire magazine between PM mail delivery and breakfast the next day. The topics they covered in my first issue ranged from fashion to health concerns. And, again, they cover the topics in very few, well-written pages. I do think the models look like under-fed children but at my age, that could be tunnel-vision (grey hair, I remember Filmore East, you get the picture?). My suggestion, take a look.

       "  'reviewText': \"Maximum PC is a magazine for electronics freaks, offering many different articles about electronics; how to buy them, how to repair them, how to get the most out of them, and how best to replace them. This magazine is aimed in one primary direction: Making the most out of the electronic devices available. This is accomplished through the many instructional articles, how to guides, and question and answer sessions.\\n\\nWhen Maximum PC isn't offering words of wisdom on ways to improve your life with electronics, the magazine is usually offering reviews of new products. The reviews section is one of the largest parts of each issue and while it does a nice job bringing new products to the forefront, the reviews are often less than stellar. Rather than analyze a few products in- depth, Maximum PC instead prefers to offer shorter reviews of many products. This part of the magazine seems more concerned with quantity than quality, in contrast to most of the remainder of the magazine.\\n\\nOne thing about Maximum PC that isn't to my liking is the technical nature of many articles. Maximum PC likes to get to the root of things (literally), and it is common to find articles talking about circuits, memory, and other boring subjects. This is fine for those who take their technology to the extremes, but I have no interest in learning about the inter-workings of the wiring inside my personal computer or the electronic pulses that cause my printer to respond on queue. This is a little too much technology for me, but I know there are some readers who will relish the depths that Maximum PC goes to when it strips down electronic devices into their component parts.\\n\\nOverall, Maximum PC is a pretty good electronics magazine for young and middle- aged adults. It loses me from time to time when it gets overly technical, but it still ranks as a good magazine about electronics. The numerous question and answer sessions, the educational articles, and the product reviews make this a magazine worth reading.\",\n",

That's a long enough wait as it is---I ended up receiving it the the end of June!  And when I called to complain...the customer service rep explained to me that it was technically within the estimated allowed time for delivery.  so bottom line...if you have an urge to order a magazine that may take half a year or so to get to you...then this is the ONE FOR YOU-hands down.  I plan on never ordering a single magazine through Amazon again.  Definitely don't send a subscription to anyone as a birthday gift- it'll maybe make it in time for the FOLLOWING birthday year..so plan years in advance!\",\n",

I don't know why anybody would want the disk version because it just costs more and there's nothing really good on the disk. As for the magazine it reviews pretty much everything that you would want to know about, even a few things you don't really want to know about. A lot of people get mad at Maximum PC because of the way they put there reviews and everything. Some months it'll be focused on MP3 Players and other months Motherboards or CPU's or something like that. I don't know how many people like this type of magazine, but I sure do. If you have come from PC World or PC Magazine and are looking for a more entertaining magazine this is for you. If you like PC World and PC Magazine and are looking for an addition to these, do not get this magazine unless you are very sure that you are going to like reading about graphics cards and cpus. So all those people that don't like computers, don't like computer gaming upgrade advise, and don't like entertaining magazines stay away from this one and stop spamming amazon with reviews of the magazine that are bias.\",\n",

I read Max PC and it takes me back to the seventies when computing power hitherto available only to businesses started to leak down to the public.\\n\\nMost of the other magazines have lost the hardware angle completely.  Max PC is for those who take pride in the hardware.  Forget the corporate drones who are forced to review the best mini-mouse for cramming work in coach class--instead, read about how to make a PC case shine like a Ferrari.  Learn how to overclock a processor with liquid cooling (who would have thought?).  It is simply fascinating and has taken me back to the days when new developments were fast and furious.

       "  'reviewText': 'I started buying this in Sept of \\'03 because of the short blurb on the cover (of every issue) \"Maximum PC - Minimum BS\".\\n\\nI have never seen that proved wrong.  Every issue is crammed full of articles that bring maximum PC goodness right to your mailbox.\\n\\nThere are articles about building and modifying your own PC, reviews of PC\\'s and PC components, a \"Watchdog\" column that keeps readers abreast of problems in the industry (and attempts to find solutions for readers, too - a nice touch), a head-to-head article that compares one similar product to another, an \"Ask the Doctor\" column that provides answers to both simple and very complex computer questions, and many others.\\n\\nMy favorite is the how-to\\'s in just about every issue.  All of the how-to\\'s show even neophytes how to get down and get dirty with mods (modifications) to their machine.  But, the articles take neither a \"write down to the lowest level\" nor a \"technogeek know-it-all\" approach - they tell you what to do and how to do it simply, and reveal many \"secrets\" you won\\'t read in mainstream computer magazines.\\n\\nAnd the reviews.  I love the \"Kick-A**\" award - you know that product is good.  And when a product doesn\\'t meet their standards they simply come right out and tell you it sucks - saving people lots of money in the bargain, I suspect.\\n\\nThis product is managed by the same people who do \"PC Gamer\" and it shows.  Many games =require= the latest and greatest machines in order to run well.  And the few game reviews shows that they know games just as well as they know computers.\\n\\nTheir writing style isn\\'t for everyone, but I really enjoy the almost in-your-face attitude that they project.  This is the kind of person I want standing behind me when I make expensive modifications to my computer system - keeping me from making mistakes before I start to turn a single screw.\\n\\nRecommended to anyone who has ever thought of opening the cover of their computer and doing thier own upgrades and modifications.  Highly recommended to any person who builds and modifies computers - especially highly recommended to any people who do this for computers that are virtually dedicated to gaming.  Well worth reading and keeping.',\n",

He wasn\\'t impressed with the first two issues and complained of advertisements crowding the magazine.  He was excited to read a good article on beginning welding in his 3rd issue.  I took some time to leaf through the magazine before writing this review.  The advertisements are exhausting.  For example, in the first 10 pages of one issue, I counted 3 full page advertisements and 3 half page advertisements.  It\\'s like that throughout the remainder of the magazine as well.  This is really unfortunate as it takes away from the readability of the magazine.  There is some useful information presented such as \"stuff we love\" which outlines favorite DIY tools, material, and gear.  There are Pro tips (example:  installing an irrigation system), reader DIY tips, and a handful of projects with decent instructions.  Unfortunately, most of the projects haven\\'t interested my husband.  We won\\'t be renewing this again.\\n\\nI haven\\'t had any problems with unwanted auto-renewal of my magazines on Amazon as long as I follow these steps to turn it off:\\n1) Go to your account and look under Membership and Subscriptions.\\n2) Find \"Print Magazines.\"\\n3) Once selected, you will see all of your current magazine subscriptions and when they will be renewed at the lowest Amazon price.\\n4) Simply turn off the \"auto-renewal\" setting by selecting auto-renewal settings and \"turn off.\"\\n\\nI\\'ve been subscribed to all of my magazines from Amazon for over 2 years now and have never had a payment request from the magazine company or a continuation of magazines arriving when I said I didn\\'t want them to.

Many PC magazines have evolved into field-specific narrow-ranged reads, but this one stays true.  It covers software, hardware, modding, gaming, and so much more.  It features content appropriate for all levels of computer users, and its reviewers are phenomenally in-depth.  Not only is the content great, but reading it proves to be remarkably enjoyable.  The magazine\\'s staff succeeds in making it seem very personal, to such a level that you feel like you know everyone there. It has a great attitude too (how can you go wrong with a magazine entitled \"Maximum PC, Minimum BS\"?) If you\\'re looking for a PC mag that covers a wide-range of interests and is still greatly enjoyable, this is the one.',\n",

At the end, they let you know which usb drive survived and which didn\\'t.\\nThis magazine covers much, much more.  However, I do not want to repeat other reviewers.  Great magazine!',\n",

If you buy your subscription on here, you're not getting the CD, which is obviously, the whole essence of the mag. The CD is done just like PC Gamer, but it just has Maximum PC on there, instead of PC Gamer, and this also means, if your PCG CD's won't auto-load, neither will the MPC ones. Since I can't see what the price is for the subscription on here, I cant tell if you're paying the same amount on here for the no CD sub, as you would with the CD. CD sub. price is $29.95. You can obviously look at the top of the page, and see what the price is. The one good thing they have is the Head 2 Head thing they have in the beginning, where they pit two products against each other. This month it was Yahoo! Mail vs. Hotmail. So this really isn't a great magazine, nor a good PC magazine (no pun). If you want a real independent magazine, go with PC Magazine.

On top of that, I have only a passing interest in PC's; I am certainly not a technician, nor am I an avid gamer. To complete the disconnect, I am 59 years old. With that background, you might be surprised to learn that I look forward to receiving each issue. So was I.\\nIt's hard to put a finger on what makes this magazine so appealing to someone like me.  First I like the style.  Other reviewrs have described it as edgy, but I think of it as fun and accessible.  I have ever read any other PC book or magazine that I would describe as anything even close to fun, but this one definately is.  Secondly, it has fascinating hardware articles that are incredibly clear and understandable.  I have learned more about video cards, memory types, and processors than I ever thought I would want to learn, all while being entertained.  I have to admit that the article on building your own super PC made me want to do just that, although I would opt for the budget version, which they also included in the article. Finally, the software reviews are first class, honest, and hardhitting.  They are written by avid, unabashed gamers, and they are not shy about calling a toad a toad.  I have used their reviews to buy christmas and birthday gifts and have never been disappointed.\\nThis magazine is one of those rare combinations of information and entertainment.  I read it cover to cover each month, usually smiling most of the way.  Needless to say, I renewed my subscription.\",\n",

The emphasis is on opening up your PC\\'s chassis and mudding around.  There\\'s also a monthly back page devoted to modding.  As a PC user I have mixed feelings about the magazine.  I\\'m not a diehard nerd (even though I can be a qualified technician as well as programmer), so I don\\'t find the incessant coverage on upgrading and modding very interesting.  The website is also a joke, not being able to offer a nice online complement to the print magazine.  On the other hand, the content is not stale like with PC Mag and (gasp!) PC World, and some of the articles can be fun to read.  The upshot is, this is worth subscribing to; it\\'s just not the \"idea\" PC mag I expected to be.',\n",

Forunately, though, the content that is included is some of the most trusted PC review content I have ever encountered.  Other PC magazines just feel like thick advertisements.  I rarely trust the reviews found in other magazines because they seem suspiciously biased towards particular manufacturers.  Not so with this magazine.\\nWhen this magazine says a particular product is good, I pay attention.\\nAs proof of the magazines impartiality, I have seen more than once a case where a product prominently advertised in the magazine actually receives a poor review within the content of the magazine.  That kind of credibility is worth its weight in gold and is the reason I continue to get this magazine.\\nI don't necessarily buy the products they talk about, but I use this magazine to at least keep my finger on the pulse of the cutting edge in PC computer hardware.\\nThere are a lot of ads, but they are mostly gathered together at the end of the magazine.  They are actually the only PC ads I pay attention to.  You will find a wide assortment of products listed for sale and in a way it is like looking at a catalog of products.  When I am done reading the magazine, I always spend a good amount of time browsing through the ads getting ideas on new hardware purchases to consider.\",\n",

Hard core gamers could care less.\\n3. They do not put as many \"tweaking\" tips as they did before.\\n  Instead, they put long articles on \"How a CPU Works\".\\n4. They need to get back to basics. HCGs (Hard Core Gamers)\\n  want to know little secrets, like:\\n  a. How companies like Alienware tweak an OS, BIOS & other\\n  \"tweakables\" to get their PCs to SCREAM.\\n5. They\\'ve began taking to much for granted, as far as the know-\\n  ledge of their average readers. For instance, they talk\\n  about Raid 0 & Raid +0 and the benifits of running such a\\n  setup, but it would be nice if they would devote a section of\\n  \"step-by-step\" instructions on how to do a raid config, with\\n  new HDs and installing a new OS, or if it can be done with\\n  your current OS installed.\\n6. Tweaks, tweaks and more tweaks. Simple (to them) the best way\\n  to configure your cabling with IDE HDs, CD Roms, CD-RW, DVE+\\n  RWs, Zip drives, etc.\\n7. How the heck to you get Advanced Power Management to work\\n  properly? I\\'ve tried setting it up in the BIOS. If you don\\'t\\n  enable it in BIOS, before loading a \"clean install\" of your\\n  OS some features are not available, when you try to configure\\n  it in Windows. For that matter, every time I try to set it up\\n  in Windows, then save the \"profile\" it tells me \"one or more\\n  of the settings are incompatible\". I\\'ve never been able to\\n  get a PC to \"hybrinate\" or go to sleep, where all the fans\\n  power down. Maybe I\\'m just dumb.\\n8. THIS IS THE BIGGIE. I\\'ve talked to a lot of HCGs, and they\\n  all (well all but one of 23) said they thought the inclusion\\n  of a monthly feature for \"DUMMIES\" would be a good choice.\\n  For example: Several people told me that when they run Si-\\n  Soft\\'s Sandra, Win98se OS, they get a recommendation to \"turn\\n  Double Buffering off\". Proble is, they cant find anyplace to\\n  do it. They looked in Win.ini, System.ini, Autoexec.bat,\\n  even the registry, but no DBLBUFF.SYS (SP?) exists. They\\n  finally just remove the file from the \"Windows\\\\System\"\\n  directory & upon re-booting, they get an error that it isn\\'t\\n  loaded because it\\'s missing or corrupt. I could go on and on.\\n9. I would be happy to write the article (for a probationary\\n  period, to check reader response, then when Maximum PC gets\\n  overwhelming positive responses and sales increase, we can\\n  talk about some type of compensation that would be fair to\\n  all parties.\\nIn spite of all the \"nit pickin\" I listed, Maximum PC is still the most excitingly entertaining PC magazine there is. I get my monthly subscription and it is all I can do to (not drop everything I\\'m doing) to start reading. I usually save it for bedtime, because (if I\\'ve had a bad day) MaxPC immediatly makes everything better. It is definatly a \"Kicka__ Magazine.\\nI am curious as to why you don\\'t offer the subscription with the CD. Becuase everyone I know gets the CD. Is it that the price would not be much better than the one offered in the mag?\\nMy worst nightmares are, they will discontinue Maxamum PC>',\n",

Just like PC Gamer, you get the same, funny, and high spirited reviews. They are all very helpful, and like others have mentioned, this is the only hardcore PC magazine around. I have written reviews about PC World, giving it bad reviews because the fact is, it won't give the content that MaxPC will. Will you EVER see an article about WATER COOLING in a PC World mag? No way! But in MaxPC, that was what the cover story was for its last issue. This mag actually TELLS YOU WHAT YOU NEED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOUR COMPUTER! You will see motherboard reviews, CPU reviews, graphics card reviews, case modding guides, PC fix-it guides, overclocking guides, the information is endless and informative. Forget PC World. They are dumb and they can't produce ANYTHING that MaxPC can!\",\n",

After reading the magazine for a while you get an idea of the components and brands you would like in your next system.  You will be able tell the fads from the trends in new hardware.  While it probably isn't cost effective to build your own system other than to impress your friends you can compare your list of components with those of the smaller computer manufacturers and come pretty close for a lot lower price.  This magazine is for someone who isn't afraid to open the case and change boards or to buy a computer from someone other than the big boys with their prepackaged systems.  You might consider this magazine if you are asking yourself why do I have to buy an extra monitor, mouse, keyboard and floppy drive with a new system?\\n  The magazine does describe in fairly good detail how to modify your system to make it what you want.  This month they even discussed what you can and can't do in upgrading a laptop including the reasons why.\\n  What don't I like about the magazine?  Being a few years past a 20 year old gamer I have to look past some of the glitz and language like Kick A** reviews.  I realize that gaming is driving the leading edge of the sound, video and computer speed advancments and that digital music is driving R/W CD's so the magazine is geared to those interests.\\n  All in all it is a good magazine to keep you current with the trends.\",\n",

It is well organized and allows you to glance through it with their summarizing \"Verdict\" boxes on each review. The editors are very good about keeping with their readers, effectively relating to them.\\nA flagship occurance, as many other readers will tell you, that sets this magazine apart is that you might find a review telling you how horrible the product is on one page and on the next see an advertisement for that same product. I build many computers and I rarely disagree with their reviews. Another useful item is the benchmark, which lets you compare system and laptop performance to others they have reviewed as well as to your own.\\nFor hardcore users, the magazine provides dependable, in-depth reviews. For beginners, it might be very intimidating, but after a couple issues, you should catch on to the style and humor enough to know more than the average person.\\nA con not mentioned in other reviews is that their web-site isn\\'t all that spectacular. However, they finally hired someone to work on it, so it should improve.',\n",

And most importantly, they have lots of information about what any true computer enthusiest either does, or wants to do: build your own machine.  This is agumented by a very good segment called \"Ask the Doctor\" that answers questions about computers, much like most good car mags.\\nIn short, they have about everything the non-business computer fiend would want, and almost nothing they wouldn\\'t.',\n",

While many of the well-known players in this field (especially the ones with \"PC\" in their name) have dedicated increasing portions of their magazines to business-related topics, Maximum PC has stayed true to the cause of helping the individual home enthusiast or expert get the most from his machine. If you want to read about B2B apps, corporate firewalls, or XML, look elsewhere, but if you want comprehensive reviews of the latest hardware and software written for people who don\\'t need a tutorial to rename a file on their PC or insert a chart into an Excel file, look no further.\\nIf you\\'re the sort of person who builds his own machine or is thinking of doing so, Maximum PC will likely prove itself useful to you. Likewise for those planning to do their own hardware upgrades. And if you\\'re like me and just like to stay aware of and knowledgeable about current products and technologies then this is still an excellent and informative read.\\nTo be fair, there are a few features that may be displeasing to some readers. The writing is occasionally glib with a tendency towards sophomoric humor. There\\'s also a fair amount of focus on gaming, particularly 3D gaming technology. And the overriding theme of much of the magazine is maximizing the speed, power, and coolness of your machine. To me these aren\\'t negative qualities, but this may not be of interest to some users.\\nAll in all this is still my favorite magazine and the one I most look forward to receiving each month.

I think the best thing about the magazine were the coupons and samples you sometimes find inside.  I prefer Cosmopolitan a lot more (as it is more well rounded).  Most of the stuff they focus on in the magazine is brand named and too pricey, and it just seems a bit shallow (the last two have had articles on plastic surgery).

       "  'reviewText': 'As a typical young female, I\\'ve read a lot of different magazines geared toward women. Most, in general, feature the same articles month after month, and therefore become repetitive and boring.  Let\\'s face it: there is only so much you can take reading about \"The Best Bedroom Moves\" issue after issue.  Allure, however, never seems dull or filled with useless amounts of recycled information.\\n\\nI began subscribing to the magazine at age 18 (I\\'m 23 now) and have never been disappointed.  Allure has articles for every age, and I find relevant information for my life, body, and health, and then I am able to find information that will interest and benefit my 50+ year old mother.  Perhaps that is part of the appeal of the magazine: any age group can enjoy it.  Not many magazines can say that.\\n\\nUnlike many other female-geared magazines, Allure offers more than just underwear pictures and \"how to please your man\" articles.  Each issue, Allure has an entire section dedicated to new health science discoveries, such as new updates about skin cancer and sleep problems. The magazine seems genuinely about women, beauty, and health, whereas other magazines make some feminists role their eyes (\"how to please your man,\" anyone?)\\n\\nLike anything else, Allure has its downfalls.  While I do appreciate the make-up, weightloss, and fashion tips, I still always feel that I can never quite live up to the expectation the magazine presents me.  I\\'m a pretty girl in good physical health, and I still- at times- feel inadequate when reading the many awesome articles of this magazine.\\n\\nOverall, I recommend Allure highly to women of all ages, shapes, and sizes.  It contains more than just the bubbly sextalk of most female magazines, and therefore you get more zest for your money.',\n",

Each month, I'm always interested in seeing the new issue and what's in store with makeup, skincare, and fashion. I disagree with one reviewer who said seventeen was a better magazine, allure isn't for teens. I think of it more as a women for all ages magazine. I do think they could use the magazine as a beauty staple, since I'm sick of seeing the worst makeup ever on girls these days.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'Allure is a great idea that\\'s poorly manifested. I love it in principle -- a magazine devoted to beauty with a heavy focus on makeup. The content, however, is short on how-to and long on buy-this-product. Much of the makeup is expensive and exclusive, unavailable to the majority of the buying public. They\\'re constantly raving over products that are quite frankly terrible, to the point where seeing Allure recommend something actually makes me less likely to try it. The fashion spreads are pointless and would be better left out, focusing on expensive items, unwearable trends, or flash-in-the-pan fads. The \"Makeup Colors\" technique is always frustrating, as the listed products never even resemble the actual look achieved. This problem is worsened by the fact that the colors of featured products rarely render true on the pages; I get sick of buying a cosmetic product only to find the color looks nothing like the way it looked on the page. It swings wildly between trends and recommendations with no apparent sense of coherence to it; its advice frequently contradicts itself from one month to the next. Finally, its focus on fluffy celebrity, name brand clothes, and rich-and-famous lifestyles (it\\'s obsessed with recommending clothes and etiquette for red-carpet \"parties\" of the kind I can\\'t begin to relate to) leads the average reader to develop a massive inferiority complex.\\n\\n Skip this one and go for Lucky for versatile fashion advice, the most important makeup tips and trends, and a wider range of ages, hairstyles, and races on the models than the bland-beautiful-young-white-girl Allure favors.',\n",

Allure is nice in that it isn't quite as varied on it's topics as the other magazines. They often have more beauty & hair related articles than other magazines and I like that about them. I really like how in just about every issue they have these Beauty 101, or Hair 101 cards that you can save to tell you how to do a manicure or do your hair a certain way. It's a nice little bonus. I did buy a few issues recently (April & May 04) and they were still including them. I do plan on subscribing again when I get the chance. Thank you for your time.\\n\\nEdited to add: It's now March 2006 and I once again have a 2 year subscription. It's still my favorite.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'Unlike the other major fashion/beauty magazines which put fashion first and beauty a distant second, the focus of \"Allure\" is 90% beauty, 10% fashion.  In fact, \"Allure\" could dispense with the fashion section entirely; the clothes aren\\'t interesting and the photo layout for the clothes is just plain dull.  And the monthly article on an acting/recording star is a waste of space.  But the makeup section and the beauty tips are great.  One of my favorite sections is the Directory, which features top beauty salons in major cities around the country.  For the past year \"Allure\" has also run a monthly makeover section featuring two women who underwent a year-long makeover mostly dedicated to losing weight and shaping up; the subjects are women readers can identify with.  \"Allure\" is one of the few fashion/beauty magazines to regularly feature models of all ethnic groups in their editorial pages with makeup shades that look good on women of every shade from ebony to ivory.  One of \"Allure\"\\'s greatest strengths is that they don\\'t pander to any makeup company or brand; they are upfront about what works and what doesn\\'t.  They have also run some serious articles about the pluses and negatives of cosmetic surgery and the risks involved.  In the world of fashion/beauty magazines, \"Allure\" occupies a special niche of its own.',\n",

For example past issues have included a peek inside at the items in some bathroom cabinets belonging to well knowed women.\\nWhat strippers at Scores use to take care of their bodies. An article on the man who inspired the movie Shampoo.\\nAnd there are many traditional articles on beauty. Allure excells at being on the cutting edge of new technology that will make you even prettier. On these pages you will find out about botox, laser surgery, high tech hair and more.\\nAllure is refreshing in that it does not have a diet article every month. In fact several years ago Allure made a point to state that it did not want to offer up a diet of the month. But Allure does share tidbits of diet information like the latest on sweeteners or water weight. It will also occasionally run true life stories on dealing with the emotional side of eating problems. And recently has tracked two women and their weight loss efforts over several months.\\nFashion articles are limited to a few pages and usually include pictorials on new trends, staking out the look of a star and the latest scoop on accessories.\\nDefinately Allure is the magazine to buy to learn how to keep your look fresh and fun!',\n",

I have a subscription to Sunset so I guess that will have to suffice, but I do wish BH&G would take that into consideration.\\n\\nOtherwise, I LOVE this magazine.  I used to get several magazines, but this was always my favorite.  It is chock full of ideas that we can really use.  And I love the photography.  What sets BH&G apart is that you can see a hint of life in these beautiful houses.  Slippers on the floor, newspaper on the table and often the owners of the home are in the pictures too.  They are sometimes blurred from movement which is actually nicer than a posed shot.  It helps set the feeling that this home is lived in and is attainable.\\n\\nI would say get this magazine right away.  I would have given it 5 stars except for the whole garden thing.\",\n",

A few ads contain coupons, for those that like to cut those little things out (unfortunately they are hardly ever for anything I want !). The paper is also a lot thinner than the higher priced home/garden publications, and the photographs do not reproduce that well on it.\\nOn the bright side, there are many nice d&eacute;cor ideas, and simply terrific recipes.\\nTaking the October 2003 edition as an example, Fall colors and produce are the theme. It has some ideas on how to display gourds, and an article on a community pumpkin patch, from the June planting by 140 neighbors and friends in a 6000 square ft. area, to harvest time.\\nThere are numerous articles on remodeling, \"Foolproof Potted Plants\", on the joys of having hardy succulents in your home, and a lovely piece with lots of photographs on actor Peter Strauss\\' gorgeous Ojai, California garden.\\nThe best article of all, is \"The Magic of Soup\", and some of these recipes are so good they might end up in your family for generations. They are simple to prepare, with easy to find ingredients, and will make a healthy, hearty meal for those frosty days ahead. Also included with the recipes is the preparation and cooking time, and nutritional statistics.\\nAs someone who writes a lot of notes and cards, I appreciate the final page which is about letter writing, and how this vanishing form of communicating is good for the soul.\\nAll things considered, this magazine gives good value, and is meant for those of us who do not live in a mansion or have hours to devote to a single recipe.',\n",

Although I do like some of the articles, I find that it seems to be ironically aimed towards the overweight reader who is experiencing sexual problems.

As to the second part of my argument, I don\\'t see why they feel a need to include sexual topics in the magazine, but if they must, they needn\\'t go as far as they do.

But there must be some reason it is still around, despite the competition.  ARTnews is a quick read, lots of things happemn between its coevers, and it seems to be of more interest to working artsts than to the big gun collectors and museums.  That is fine: the art world is bizarre enough in its diffuse goals (when there are some evident!), and this journal seems to satisfy the casual magazine collector.  The writing by contributing editors is definitely improving and some of the critiques are very eloquent.  A good bargain art periodical\",\n",

The November 2001 for instance, has fashion design, with 3 articles on art/fashion, and one on Mary McFadden\\'s sculpture collection. It also has \"The New Climate\", about art after 9/11, from a response by several artists to the loss of a 100 million $ in art.\\nAlso included is a large section on new art books, and the obligatory \"avante garde\" piece. There are too many \"shock art\" articles in this magazine for my taste, therefore 4 instead of 5 stars, but I guess some people still consider this a \"trend\".\\nGood quality paper, excellent color reproduction, and the wide range of art represented make this a useful magazine for both artist and collector.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'Started subscription in October 2015. Used to be a subscriber in years past. Magazine tends to repeat articles, just change them up a bit year to year. I like the new tool blurbs. This is my warning, not noted in the above price/issues per year info. When I subscribed, you got 10 issues per year. As of now (Feb 2017) they only publish 8 issues per year. Magazine is dying, trying to keep itself afloat. Also they send out offers for handyman books. If you do not return the invoice cancelling the shipment, the book will be sent and then you either pay or have to deal with shipping it back. If you just toss the notice as junk mail you will be surprised when the book shows up. I will not be renewing when it is time, since I can check it out at my local library or read online through various apps.\\n\\nOne last gripe. The topic of some articles is beyond the scope of this type of magazine. This is geared toward homeowners, not professional contractors. But in the current issue(March 2017) there is an article starting on page 24  and goes to page 31 title Best Pro Tips Avoid Framing Tips. My guess is that most (nearly all) are really not going to be attempting their own framing of a structure of any size. The following article (building patio chairs) is more along the line of something useful.',\n",

Also, what's with devoting 8 magazine pages to dogs? Maybe there's more truth there than MH's editors know.
